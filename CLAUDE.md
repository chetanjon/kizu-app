# CLAUDE.md — Instructions for Claude Code working on kizu

You are helping build **kizu**, a private **group taste space** for small friend groups (5–20 people). This file is your live context. It supersedes the old witness-app instructions (archived in `CLAUDE-old.md`). `KIZU-DESIGN-DOC.md` describes an EARLIER product direction — treat it as historical, not current. `AGENTS.md` has Next.js framework rules worth reading.

## What kizu is, in one paragraph

kizu is a web-first app where a small group of friends drop the **movies, music, and places (outside)** they love into one blended space, rate them their own way, react, and queue what they want to act on. An AI **"vibe read"** reads the group's collective taste back as a shareable card. The product has pivoted twice (accountability → witness → taste space); **taste space is the keeper.** It is LIVE at **https://kizu.app**.

---

## The strategic spine (this drives every decision)

- **Core outcome = trusted discovery:** "I never run out of great things to watch / listen to / go do, from people I trust — and I can decide *tonight*." The **queue is the product**; the **vibe read is the hook**; romance/relationships are a deferred, opt-in byproduct, never the headline.
- **North-star metric:** *recs that landed per active group per week.* A "landed" rec = someone queued a thing another person dropped/sent and marked it loved/liked. Every feature must move this number or it gets cut.
- **#1 structural risk = low frequency.** Taste discovery isn't daily. We fight this with: Kizu Curate (manufactures a daily reason to open), a low bar for what's drop-worthy (a craving, a lyric, a rewatch), and the queue ("what do I do tonight?" = a recurring real need).

---

## Tech stack — locked

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 + TypeScript (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (tokens in `src/app/globals.css`)
- **DB / Auth / Realtime:** Supabase (project `undcbbwiytfzquriwwqx`)
- **AI (vibe read + Curate automation):** **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** — free tier, the budget is $0. The provider is swappable in `src/lib/vibe.ts` (upgrade to Claude if budget ever appears). `src/lib/claude.ts` exists but is not the default path.
- **Hosting:** Vercel (Hobby, free; auto-deploys from `main`). Domain `kizu.app` via Squarespace DNS.

**Budget = $0.** Do not introduce anything that requires payment without flagging it first. Don't suggest switching frameworks/ORMs/backends without a very strong reason.

---

## Auth + write pattern (learned the hard way)

Route-handler writes with the user-scoped Supabase client hit `new row violates RLS` (`auth.uid()` is null on writes in route handlers). **Pattern used everywhere:** authorize with `getUser()` + a membership check, then write via `createAdminClient()` (service role), setting `created_by`/`user_id` from the verified user. Follow this for every new write route.

**Embed gotcha:** `items` ↔ `users` is an ambiguous embed (`created_by` AND via `reactions`) → `PGRST201` and silent 0 rows. Always disambiguate with the FK hint, e.g. `users!items_created_by_fkey(name)`.

---

## Code style preferences

- **Clean components, low abstraction.** Prefer readable code over 5 layers of indirection. Don't preemptively factor things out.
- **Server components first; client components only when needed.** App Router patterns.
- **Supabase types:** `src/lib/database.types.ts`. Regenerate (or hand-update to match) after every schema change.
- **No CSS-in-JS, no styled-components, no MUI, no shadcn-by-default.** Tailwind utilities inline; a `.module.css` next to a component only if genuinely needed.
- **No state-management library** (no Zustand/Redux/Jotai). React state + URL state + Supabase realtime are enough unless I ask.
- **Small files.** A 200-line component is fine; an 800-line one should be split.
- **No premature optimization.** No memoization/virtualization/caching without a measured problem.
- **Ask before adding npm dependencies** — quick justification first.

## Performance rules — LOAD-BEARING (perf overhaul 2026-07-01; don't regress)

The app went from 1–2.5s page loads to ~200ms by removing serialized round trips. Every new feature must honor these:

1. **Never add a sequential `await` to a page's data path.** Batch independent queries in ONE `Promise.all`; enrichments (`signPhotos` / `availabilityMap` / `fetchPositiveVerdicts`) run together in a second batch after the rows land. Look at `home/page.tsx` for the canonical shape.
2. **Auth is verified locally.** Middleware + `getCurrentUser()` use `supabase.auth.getClaims()` (ES256, no network). Never reintroduce `auth.getUser()` on the page/middleware path. `getCurrentUser()` returns a slim `{ id, email }` — need more user fields? Query `users` inside your page's Promise.all.
3. **Tab pages reuse the layout's request-memoized `getMemberships`** (`@/lib/auth`) — never re-query `group_members` for the active group.
4. **External fetches in the render path need a hard timeout** (`AbortSignal.timeout`) + `next: { revalidate }`. See `providers.ts`.
5. **Covers:** list surfaces (feed, reel, watchlist rows, grids) use `imgSm()` (w342); only single-card/detail surfaces use `img()` (w500).
6. **Client router cache is ON** (`staleTimes.dynamic: 30`). Any mutation whose result must appear on another tab (save, drop, delete, verdict) MUST call `router.refresh()` after success — otherwise it looks lost for up to 30s.
7. **`sw.js` caches immutable assets only** (`/_next/static`, cover art). Never cache pages or APIs in the service worker.
8. **New tabs get a content-shaped `loading.tsx` skeleton** (see `home/loading.tsx`), not a spinner.
9. **Feed-type queries stay bounded** (`.limit(...)`) — nothing unbounded on the hot path.
10. **Keep-warm:** `.github/workflows/keep-warm.yml` pings prod every 10 min so Hobby cold starts never hit users. Don't delete it without a replacement.

## Brand DNA — visual constraints (source of truth: `src/app/globals.css`)

Locked direction (rebranded 2026-06-29, light→dark): **cinematic-brutalist-glass** — a dark warm-black stage, brutalist cream frames with hard blur-less shadows, glass on floating layers. Roughly 50 brutalist / 25 cinematic-dark / 25 glass. *(The earlier light "neo-brutal cream paper" direction is retired; `CLAUDE-old.md`-era. Real poster/album/place art is the design — chrome gets out of its way.)*

- **Stage:** warm black `paper #16130E` (the page) with a faint violet **nebula** glowing from the top (set on `body`). Deepest black `stage #0D0B09`. Elevated dark cards: `surface #1B1610`, `surface-2 #241D15`.
- **Text + frames:** primary text/ink `#F6F1EA` (token `--color-ink`, now light); secondary `ink-2 #C7BEB0`; `muted #948D7F`; hairline `--color-hair` (faint light). The brutalist **cream frame** around art is `--color-frame #EDE3CE` (use `border-frame`, ~2.5px).
- **THE SIGNATURE:** a hard, **blur-less COLORED shadow** behind cover art, tinted to its type — use the `.shadow-watch/.shadow-listen/.shadow-go` (and `-sm`) utility classes, or `SHADOW`/`SHADOW_SM` from `item-render.ts`. Violet `5px 5px 0 #7C5CE6` is the default brutalist shadow for kizu-voice surfaces (hero, nav, CTAs). Dark `#0D0B09` for subtle grounding. **No `#14110F` shadows** (invisible on the dark stage).
- **RED `#FF3B5C` is PRECIOUS** — only the `kizu.` wordmark dot (and a bare notification ping). Never buttons/links/fills.
- **Signature accent = violet `#6B4BD6→#7C5CE6`** (`--color-vibe`) + brighter `--color-vibe-2 #A98BFF` for active states/highlights: primary buttons, the floating glass nav tile/dot, headline highlights. The **vibe read = an animated aurora gradient framed in cream** (now `linear-gradient(135deg,#7C5CE6,#FF6F9C,#FF8A5B)`) — the one show-stopper; render it inline-expanded on Home when a read exists.
- **Type colors (dark-tuned, brighter to read/glow on black):** movies/watch = blue `#5B8DEF`, music/listen = pink `#FF6F9C`, outside/go = green `#5DCAA5` (in `item-render.ts` `TYPE`). They ride a saturated full-width **type bar** above titles (dark text on the color) and tint the colored cover-shadow.
- **Glass** (`.glass` utility) on floating layers only: the nav pill, chips over color/art, rating badges. `rgba(255,255,255,.10)` + `blur(16px)`.
- **Fonts:** Archivo (`font-h`), Plus Jakarta Sans (`font-b`), Space Mono (`font-m`). Unchanged.
- Luxurious whitespace; **anti-doomscroll** — the feed should help you *decide*. "You're all caught up" is a feature.

Use token names (`bg-paper`, `bg-surface`, `text-ink`, `text-vibe-2`, `border-frame`, `border-hair`, `font-h/b/m`, the `.shadow-*`/`.glass` utilities), not raw hexes, in components.

## Voice — for any UI copy

Direct, a little knowing, never cheerful SaaS. kizu speaks sparingly — **one on-brand line only on earned moments** (first drop in the group, a rec that landed, the weekly read), then it's quiet. Cryptic and short, especially in notifications — trigger curiosity, don't spoil it.

- ✅ "good taste runs in the group." (the tagline)
- ✅ "someone left this for you."
- ✅ "it landed."
- ✅ "you're all caught up."
- ❌ "Welcome back! 🎉 Let's check in!"  ❌ exclamation-mark hype  ❌ generic emoji spam
If copy sounds like a typical SaaS app, it's wrong.

## What kizu is NOT — LOAD-BEARING exclusions

Push back before implementing any of these:

- ❌ Algorithmic "For You" ranking / engagement-maximizing feed. Discovery is **trust-based**, from your people + Curate — not a black-box algorithm.
- ❌ Infinite scroll. The feed is **bounded** (small group = finite content). Honor the empty space.
- ❌ Public-by-default content. kizu is **private group** first. (Rec-as-invite no-wall links are the one controlled exception — a single shared item, not a public profile.)
- ❌ Personal streaks / dark-pattern retention. Group rituals and earned status are OK; streaks are not.
- ❌ Individual scores/ratings *of friends*. We rate taste, not people.
- ❌ **Fake friend activity.** Seeding is done HONESTLY via Kizu Curate (a clearly-labeled house persona), never by faking humans inside a trust circle.
- ❌ Romance/dating as the headline. Taste-match % ships **platonic**; "kizu match" (opt-in, consenting, separate surface) is a deferred future layer with its own safety design.
- ❌ Monetization of any kind (legal constraint — F-1 visa).
- ❌ Push notifications by default. In-app, cryptic, earned-event notifications only to start; PWA push is a deliberate later decision, not an assumption. **(Override, 2026-06-27: PWA push is now live, and we deliberately push — cryptic, push-only, no in-app row — on EVERY drop to the rest of the group, not just earned events. These auto-clear from the tray once the user opens kizu. Owner-approved exception to the "earned-event only" rule.)**

If I ask for one of these, say so and ask me to confirm before building.

## Current phase — "Trusted Discovery" full build

We approved building the full strategic spine, **sequenced to ship in testable increments** (not one big-bang). Modules, roughly in build order:

1. **Queue + "landed"** (the core discovery loop) + **filter chips** (all · movies · music · outside)
2. **Kizu Curate** — hand-curated first (Wizard-of-Oz admin entry) to tune the voice; automate later
3. **Rec-as-invite** (drop *for* a specific person; no-wall `/r/<token>` for non-members) + **"recs that landed"** status
4. **Notifications** — in-app, cryptic, earned-event only
5. **Weekly ritual** — scheduled (cron) weekly group vibe read = the appointment mechanic
6. **Taste DNA profile** — the investment artifact that visibly grows
7. **Taste-match %** — platonic; the seed for a future opt-in "kizu match"
8. **Curate automation** — once the voice is dialed in

The current creative open question is **how the feed itself should look** — explicitly NOT a generic scroll/masonry feed. Resolve that before building module 1's feed surface.

## How I want you to work with me

1. **Plan before you code.** Give a plan (files, schema, routes) first; wait for "okay, do it."
2. **Small commits, frequent verification.** Summarize each meaningful diff.
3. **Push back on bad ideas** that contradict the spine or the locked-out list. I'd rather argue 5 minutes than ship the wrong thing.
4. **No over-engineering.** Build for ~50 friends, not 1M users.
5. **Ask before installing dependencies.**
6. **When stuck on UI, ask for a screenshot.**
